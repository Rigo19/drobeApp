# DrobeApp
## Vision:

 This project consists of team members James Cowley, Elham Ul Islam, Rigo Lizaola, Blake Jameson, and Mackenzie Toliver.

 We are creating an application where you have access to a virtual wardrobe. Here, you can save the different outfits and clothes you have.

Anyone who has interest in fashion or clothes to any extent is in for a great experience.

We're wanting to create a place where those who love clothing and the possibility of endless styles have somewhere they can find home in. This is a place where one can seek to find enjoyment and inspiration from friends as they share their outfits. We aim for this community to be a welcoming place that one can find joy in.
